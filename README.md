Homework 10 for shaolin AI

In this homework, we took a few different data sets from 2019 and Q1 of 2020, and used them to create a few different ML models.

First I converted all the data into binary forms to allow the models to be able to tell what gategory to put the data in for the training sets.

I then created both a logistic regression model and a random forest classifier model to see which one was better. initially, the RFC was better, when the data was unscaled.
After scaling the data, the logistic regression model was a lot better at doing its job.
